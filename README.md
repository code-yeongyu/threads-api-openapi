The unofficial API for Threads. This repository contains the OpenAPI YAML file that documents the reverse-engineered APIs currently available for Threads. This project is inspired by [junhoyeo/threads-api](https://github.com/junhoyeo/threads-api).

Note that it's a reverse-engineered api, and it requires extra effort to use this api, like handling tokens for authentication. For more informations, checkout [here](https://github.com/junhoyeo/threads-api/blob/main/threads-api/src/threads-api.ts). I recommend you to use ChatGPT for better understanding of Threads API.

## 🧩 OpenAPI Code Generators

To accelerate your development process, we recommend using OpenAPI code generators. These tools can help you generate client libraries, server stubs, and API documentation based on the OpenAPI specification.

Here are a few popular OpenAPI code generators you can use:

- [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
- [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)
- [NSwag](https://github.com/RicoSuter/NSwag)

Choose the code generator that best fits your development environment and requirements. Refer to their respective documentation for installation and usage instructions.
